# Machine Learning

## Chapter 1-1

- Grew out of work in AI
- New capability for computers

examples:

- Database mining(Web click data,medical records)
- Applications can't program by hand 
  Eg: Natural Language Processing(NLP)
- Self-customizing programs
  Eg: Amazon,Netflix product recommendations


## Chapter 1-2

Machine Learning Definition
Arthur Samuel:
  Field of study that gives computers ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
Tom Mitchell:
  Well-posed Learning Problem: A compupter program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T,as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Machine Learning Algorithms:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsuppervised Learning


## Chapter 1-3

Supervised Learning: right answers were given in the dataset
 also called regression problem: Regression: Predict continuous valued output

Classification Problem: Discrete valued output
